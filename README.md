# Katana---HTML-Renderer

Katana is very, very limited at the moment.

Only the following tags can be rendered

"<h1>"
"<h2>
"<h3>"
"<h4>
"<h5>"
"<h6>
"<p>
  
Featrues:
  
  Due to the way code is rendered, you do not have to close your tags
  It is very fast, on my system it was able to render (a very basic webpage) in 140 ms! And most of that was probably interpreting
  
 Limitations:
  It is text only
  No CSS parsing
  No JavaScript - at all
  Can't parse actual files, all code has to be predefined in a python list
