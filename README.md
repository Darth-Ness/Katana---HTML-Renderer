# Katana-HTML-Renderer

Katana is very, very limited at the moment.
When using the dev version you get the lastest features, but it is not as stable as the main branch.

Only the following tags can be rendered: `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`, `p`, `img`, `button`, `br`

## Install
If you would like to test this on your computer run the following commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Darth-Ness/Katana-HTML-Renderer.git
cd Katana-HTML-Renderer
python3 importer.py
```
  
## Features
- Due to the way code is rendered, you do not have to close your tags.
- It is very fast
  
## Limitations
- No CSS parsing.
- No JavaScript at all.

## Dependencies
- Tkinter
- Pillow
- Git
