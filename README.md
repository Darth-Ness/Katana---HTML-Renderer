# Katana---HTML-Renderer

Katana is very, very limited at the moment.

Only the following tags can be rendered

h1
h2
h3
h4
h5
h6
p

Install:
  If you would like to test this on your computer run the following commands<br>
    <br>git clone https://github.com/Darth-Ness/Katana-HTML-Renderer.git <br>
    cd Katana-HTML-Renderer<br>
    chmod u+x parser.py <br>
    python3 importer.py
  
Featrues:
  
  Due to the way code is rendered, you do not have to close your tags
  It is very fast, on my system it was able to render (a very basic webpage) in 140 ms! And most of that was probably interpreting
  
 Limitations:
  It can only render text
  No CSS parsing
  No JavaScript - at all
